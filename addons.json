Blocks all ads: video ads (including YouTube video ads), rich media advertising, unwanted pop-ups, banners and text ads (including Facebook advertisements);\n2. Speeds up page loading and saves bandwidth, thanks to the missing ads and pop up windows;\n3. Blocks many spyware, adware, and dialer installers;\n4. Protects your privacy by blocking common third-party tracking systems;\n5. Protects you from malware and phishing.\n\nHow can AdGuard ad blocker protect your privacy?\n\nJust enable Tracking Protection filter in AdGuard settings. It completely removes all forms of tracking from the Internet. AdGuard has one of the largest tracker filters containing more than 5,000 rules.\n\nHow to remove social media with AdGuard?\n\nTired of all the «Like» buttons and similar widgets infesting all of your frequented web pages? Just enable AdGuard \"Social media filter\" and forget about them.\n\nHow can AdGuard ad blocker protect you from online threats?\n\nAt the moment we’ve got more than 2,000,000 harmful websites on record. AdGuard can block domains known to spread malware, protecting your computer against viruses, Trojan horses, worms, spyware, and adware. AdGuard really lowers the risk of virus infections and prohibits access to harmful websites to prevent potential attacks.\n\nWhy does AdGuard require permissions?\n\n    Access your data for all websites and Access browser tabs: both permissions are necessary for AdGuard to apply all kinds of cosmetic processing to the pages content. Naive ad blocking would simply block ad servers, and leave broken elements and first-party ads on the pages. AdGuard applies special cosmetic rules to make pages look clean and tidy.\n    Access browser activity during navigation: this permission is necessary to keep track of navigation events in order to apply rules when the time is right.\n\n\n==============================\n\nRelease notes:\nhttps://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardBrowserExtension/releases\n\n==============================\n\nFree and Open Source:\nhttps://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardBrowserExtension\n\n==============================\n\nFound a bug?

You can choose from many available male and female voices. You can also set the pitch of the voice and the reading speed. Supports PDF. Supports EPUB (via the excellent EPUBReader extension).\n\nRead Aloud is a Firefox extension that uses text-to-speech technology to convert webpage text to audio. It works on a variety of websites, including news sites, blogs, fan fiction, publications, textbooks, school and class websites, online universities and course materials.\n\nRead Aloud is aimed at users who prefer to listen to content instead of reading, people with dyslexia or other learning disabilities, children learning to read, or simply to provide users with alternative way to consume web content.\n\nRead Aloud allows you to select from a variety of text-to-speech voices, including those provided natively by the browser, as well as by text-to-speech cloud service providers such as Google Wavenet, Amazon Polly, IBM Watson, and Microsoft. Some of the cloud-based voices may require additional in-app purchase to enable.\n\nRecent developments in machine learning and artificial intelligence has enabled very high-quality speech synthesis. Google Wavenet, Amazon Polly voices, for example, use bleeding edge technology to provide life-like synthetic speech that is close to that of human speech. Read Aloud allows you to use your own Google Cloud Platform and Amazon Web Services account to enable these voices.\n\nTo use Read Aloud, simply navigate to the web page you want to read, then click the Read Aloud icon on the Firefox menu. In addition, the shortcut keys ALT-P, ALT-O, ALT-Comma, and ALT-Period can be used to Play/Pause, Stop, Rewind, and Forward, respectively. You may select the text you want to read before activating the extension. Right clicking on the selected text will provide you with yet another context-menu option to activate Read Aloud.\n\nTo change the voice, reading speed, pitch, or enable text highlighting, go to the Options page either by right clicking on the Read Aloud icon and choose Options, or by clicking the Gear button on the extension popup (you'll need to stop playback to see the Gear button).\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nPersonal information\nIf you use one of the Premium Voices, you'll be asked to sign in to your Google account and grant Read Aloud access to your basic user profile, which includes name and email address. We require this information for usage tracking, since the Premium Voices requires making a purchase when usage exceeds the monthly free tier. If you don't use the Premium Voices, you don't need to sign in, and no information is collected.\n\nBrowsing history\nWe do not track the user's browsing history. We realize the importance of privacy, so we make sure our extensions require only the minimum set of browser permissions to operate. In particular, during installation, it does not ask for the \"Read your browsing history\" or the \"Read and change all your data on the websites you visit\" permissions, both of which could be used to track the user's browsing history.\n\nText converted to speech\nWhen you select one of the standard text-to-speech voices, the speech synthesis occurs locally on your computer and is never sent to the internet. And neither the input text nor the synthesized speech are saved or stored on your computer.\n\nWhen you select one of the premium text-to-speech voices, the input text is sent to our cloud server for synthesis. The server may use your anonymized IP address and User-Agent data for purpose of analytics, abuse management, and service improvement. The server may cache the input text, as well as the synthesized speech, for short amounts of time as part of its normal operation; it does not save them to any type of permanent storage.\n\nGeolocation\nIf you select a voice that is synthesized on our server, your anonymized IP address may be used for geolocation for analytics purposes.\n\nIssue reporting and contact forms\nIf you use the in-app report-issue function or use the contact form on our support website, your comments and information may be kept in our support database for a maximum of 6 months.\n\nAnalytics\nThe extensions use Firefox Addons Store's built-in analytics. Firefox will collect basic extension usage data, including when the extension is installed, invoked, and uninstalled. The extension may also use its own counters to analyze usage patterns.
